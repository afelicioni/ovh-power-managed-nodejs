# ovh-power-managed-nodejs

OVHcloud opened managed node.js hosting platform to testers under 
[OVHclous Labs program](https://labs.ovh.com/managed-nodejs), for which deployment can be leveraged via [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) using this repository as template.

Having [OVHcloud getting started guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/web-power/getting-started-with-power-web-hosting/) as reference, source code and action workflows can be set up on single repository.

path | purpose
--- | ---
src | sample NodeJS source
.github/workflows | workflow procedure and utility scripts

Using Github action secrets to store OVHcloud and Github related cretentials to make everything work.

## Definitions

As *destination* meaning entity where app will be deployed; actual scenario represented by managed hosting by OHVcloud.

Using *remote* in reference to the git service hosting app code, represented by Github in actual scenario. 

## Action secrets

secret | purpose
--- | ---
`DESTINATION_FINGERPRINT` | Represents fingerprint for which autenticity will be checked during workflow. Can be generated with command like `ssh-keyscan -t rsa ssh.clusterNNN.hosting.ovh.net \| ssh-keygen -lf -` and at the end sould be checked via OVHclould. On matching, its made an attempt to add key to `known_hosts`
`DESTINATION_HOST` | Represents destination ssh host, sent you from OHVcloud on activation email. Can be a value similar to `ssh.clusterNNN.hosting.ovh.net`
`DESTINATION_IDENTITY` | Represents ssh private key to connect to deploy server. Copy & paste full content, multiline, including `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- (...) -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`
`DESTINATION_USER` | Represents destination ssh user, sent you from OHVcloud on activation email. Can be a value similar to `efjoidlk`.
`REMOTE_FINGERPRINT` | Represents fingerprint for which autenticity will be checked during workflow. Can be generated with command like `ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com \| ssh-keygen -lf -` and at the end sould be checked against [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection). On matching, its made an attempt to add key to known_hosts
`REMOTE_HOST` | Represents remote git host accessed via ssh. On actual scenario value is `github.com`.
`REMOTE_IDENTITY` | Represents ssh private key to connect to git. Copy & paste full content, multiline, including `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- (...) -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`
